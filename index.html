                        p Combinator is an app for people who know where they're going but not how to get there.
                        p Have you ever had a set of numbers and another number you need to reach with the afore mentioned set of numbers?
                        p Finance professionals around the world sit in abject misery every day because of this very problem.
                        p Today we say "No more!"
